how it should improve equity and also how it might affect other concerns.
make a note of implementation issues that might make your algorithm more practical or more difficult to implement

I believe a good first step would be for the algorithm to not randomly assign any seats purchased together in one transaction, as I think this would be the most ethical choice.
However, that doesn't account for families, groups or individuals that may purchase tickets at different times.

Airlines currently ask when you purchase tickets if you are traveling with a child and how old that child is. It would seem that there should be a way for parents/guardians to indicate that they are a family unit at the time of the ticket purchase, whether or not tickets are purchased in the same transation.
