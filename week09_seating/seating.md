##Async Assignment Directions

- describe how the algorithm should improve equity and also how it might affect other concerns.
- make a note of implementation issues that might make your algorithm more practical or more difficult to implement

I believe a good first step would be for the algorithm to not randomly assign any seats purchased together in one transaction, as I think this would be the most ethical choice.
However, that doesn't account for families, groups or individuals that may purchase tickets at different times.

Airlines currently ask when you purchase tickets if you are traveling with a child and how old that child is. It would seem that there should be a way for parents/guardians to indicate that they are a family unit at the time of the ticket purchase, whether or not tickets are purchased in the same transation.

I also believe that passengers with disabilities should be able to indicate information about this at the ticket transation time. So that if these passengers need assistance, they are able to remain with the person they need assistance. 

In both of the above cases, maybe passengers could submit some form of documentation showing proof of relationship or need, although I am not sure what this documentation would be. 

According to one of the articles posted for this week's assignment, there are very real safety concerns, for example, with regards to the evacuation of plane, in an emergency situation when families are not seating together. So it would seem that we need better regulation in the form of policy. The article stated that although legislation has been put in place, that how it would be implemented and enforced has not yet been decided, which means it has no teeth currently.

I was shocked to learn, from reading the articles that some airlines are using passengers personal data in order to purposely split families up. This concern has definitely been a stressful one for my husband and I when we travel, since we have a small child. It is enfuriating to find out that this is being done intentionally. We now pay the extra money to have the piece of mind, but as discussed in class, this may not be an option for some families due to economic restraints. 

I think the algorithm should account for this. Just have families have to fill out forms for school reporting their financial information for things like free lunch, I think that passengers could be prompted to submit documentation of their financial background so that they show that they cannot afford to pay extra to sit together and should therefore be able to sit together due to financial need. I can imagine, however, that passengers may not want to devulge this level of private information to airline companies.
